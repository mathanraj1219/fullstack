MOU - MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

Develop a web-based portal to track activities under each Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

This will provide a central hub for monitoring progress, fostering collaboration, and improving transparency for all involved.
By streamlining data collection and reporting, the portal aims to enhance decision-making and ensure successful MOU implementation.
